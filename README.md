**YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing with Streamlit and SQL**
Hi i am guru in this project i explored the development of a user-friendly application for harvesting and warehousing data from YouTube channels. It leverages the power of the YouTube Data API, Streamlit for a web-based interface, and a relational database (SQL) for structured data storage and analysis. It leverages the YouTube Data API to collect information on channels and videos, stores it initially in a MongoDB data lake, and then allows users to migrate the data to a structured SQL database for further analysis. A web application built with Streamlit serves as the interface for users to search for channels, view retrieved data, and explore it through SQL queries and visualizations. This system empowers users to collect and analyze YouTube channel data, offering valuable insights for content creators, marketers, and social media researchers.
